Looking through the gitstats it's fairly clear that for most, if not all, of the projects, the stats taken via hand was way off compared to stats taken via gitstats

Comments after running gitstats:

gitstats found only one contributor and a slightly smaller number of lines of code. Uncertain of why this is, though the former discrepancy could just be that the RCOS page (my source) uses a more generous definition of "contributor". Likewise, the slight differences in the number of lines of code could just amount to the different ways of counting lines used by gitstats and the git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l command.

Comments after running gitstats:

It shows 5 authors but 2 of them are the same people using different user names.	It only counts 9347 lines... but it has a graph so it must be right? It shows the same date for the last commit and first commit
(cant find branch information)

The leader looks like Gabriel Van Dehei, he started it and did the most work
