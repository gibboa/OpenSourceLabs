It is important to choose a license so that your users understand what they are allowed to do with your software. It is even more important for your open source community so that your potential developers know what they are getting into, and whether or not it is worth their time/effort to contribute, or whether it suits their business/personal needs.

If there is no explicit license then all rights are reserved to the creator and you really don't have an explicit right to do anything with it. Also you have no idea what your rights will be in the future, or what will happen with any code you contribute. Its basically a waste of time to contribute to an unlicensed project. (its not really even open source if there's no license to ensure it)

Yes to a degree. Its really a matter of competition between Gopher and the HTTP standard. Gopher's lost the advantages of open source, by relying too much on internal innovation, bad PR concerning licensing, and falling victim to too much forking. On the other hand the increased support for HTTP via an open source community gave it an edge and it out-competed gopher. Had there no been an alternative, we might be using Gopher today, but unfortunately there was an alternative and it was adopted instead.

The .NET Core seems to be intended for maximum flexibility. It is supposed to run on all major OS's (macOS, Linux, Windows), and all architectures. Microsoft seems to have trouble getting its propriety software to work well, and so getting software to work on pretty much everything would be that much more difficult. To that end, I think the use of the MIT license to build an open source community around the .NET Core would be very helpful in getting it to work well on as many systems as they intend it to. I also assume that a high level of adoption / mind share is important to them and their business model so what they give up in not having the software be proprietary, they probably gain in other ways.

(Table 8) We thought about a web application that helps students keep track of their finances during college. Want it to be reliable and secure, and have strong cross browser compatibility. We chose the MIT license to keep things simple and open.

Since Apache/BSD seems to be the most free, I would say it is the best for the common good. This is debatable since proprietary software, Apple/Microsoft, has done quite a lot for the common good and the advancement of computing in general. As long is you're into the Richard Stallman-esque ethos of free software then I would say Apache/BSD is the best for both the common good as well as developers. GPL is close but slightly more business oriented and LGPL is even more business oriented. I feel like the developer could go either way. If they are more into increased software freedom then they might do Apache, but they may well be satisfied with GPL or LGPL. For Business I think that LGPL would be best since it is applied to library's and a business may want to build proprietary software upon reliable open source libraries. But to the extent that open source communities can lowered development costs, businesses may also find uses for GPL software as well.

My projects might be to make a browser or browser extension that displays websites in a different way. It would make a game out of the site. So you would still find info and follow hyperlinks but they would bet translated into a physical space that you would explore as a game. (Its totally pointless but fun? but maybe someone could find something useful to do with it) I doubt it would be able to do much with script-heavy pages but it would be an interesting way to surf the web.

I like the Apache 2.0 license in theory but probably would go with the MIT license in practice since it is shorter and easier to understand. I imagine I would want a license that give maximum freedom to make it as easy as possible for people to use my code if they find it interesting (particularly since this idea is not very marketable)
